#Global-Weather-Pattern-Analysis

## Project Intro/Objective
This project investigates the role of latitude in determining local weather patterns, including temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, based on weather data of a large number of cities. Furthermore, 	I also aim to visualize the discovered pattern through map visualization.

### Methods Used
* Random Sampling
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Matplotlib
* API
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML

## Project Description
The data source is the OpenWeatherMap API, and the city list is randomly generated. Key insights are then uncovered via regression analysis and Statistical Inference via Python. Finally, the revealed global pattern is visualized via API as a heatmap with a tooltip mentioning each city's most searched hotel.
