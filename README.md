# Python-api-Challenge
This project contains two complementary sections. The first section focuses on a sampling of 500 cities and an analysis of latitude's impact on local weather characteristics. This goal is achieved by extracting temperature, humidity and other local weather statistics of sampled cities using OpenWeatherMap API and performing regression analysis with plots to visualize them. The second section focuses on finding five cities with the most tourist-friendly weather among sampled towns and find the best-located hotel in these cities. Though Google Map API, I visualized patterns of humidity intensity and locations of five best-located hotels on google map image with heat layer and markers.
